I'm finally awake, I cant remember what happend last night and where am I now. My leg is aching as hell.
In my mouth I fell salt and sand. I open my eyes and see an island, wtf?! I was too drunk to remember anything from last night, and now
I'm obviousley not on my boat. Where am I? How did I survive? And I am really thirsty.

I see a bottle of water near to me...

1. Take a bottle to drink
2. Check my body and look around
